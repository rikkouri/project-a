Object Oriented Programming

*   What is OOP?
    - OOP attempts to treat program concepts as data models and relationships. So, for example, if we were writing a Phonebook app, we would try to identify the models or objects that comprise it. They might be:
        * Phonebook object, which can contain n Persons. This might have a function called "getMembers" which returns a collection of all the persons in the Phonebook. Other functions might include "addToPhonebook" and "deleteFromPhonebook"
        * Person object, which is a child of the Phonebook in a one-to-many relationship. The Person object might have properties such as:
            - Name
            - Address
            - Phone number
            - Picture
