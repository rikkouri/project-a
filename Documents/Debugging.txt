Debugging

* What is debugging?
    - Identifying and correcting errors in program
    - Types of bug - cosmetic, logical or semantic, runtime
        * Cosmetic - problem with appearance of software
        * Logical / semantic - program works but produces unexpected results
        * Runtime - errors that cause program to crash even though it compiles / appears ok
* Debugging strategies
    - Replication, replication, replication
        * Most important factor in fixing a bug is being able to replicate it
    - Console logging
        * Output variables to console to inpect during execution
    - Stack trace
        * When provided by an exception can point to the precise line of code that is causing the problem
    - Debugger instrumentation
        * Breakpoints
        * Stepping through
        * Variable inspection
