Stack and Heap
* What is a stack?
    - Memory reserved for thread execution - variables etc.
    - Reserved in LIFO fashion
    - Faster than heap due to allocation pattern - easier to keep track
    - Frequent reuse means tends to be mapped to processor cache - fast
    - Attached to thread and reclaimed when thread killed
* What is a heap?
    - Memory set aside for dynamic allocation
    - No pattern to allocation and deallocation
    - Typically multi-threading safe - performance hit
    - Can get fragmented
